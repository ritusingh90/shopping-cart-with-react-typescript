The material is kept up to date by me and the community. In the road to learn react, I want to offer a foundation before you start to dive into the broader react ecosystem. It has less tooling and less external state management, but a lot of information around react. It explains General concepts, patterns and best practices in a real world react application. You will learn to build your own react application. It covers real world features like pagination, client-side caching and interactions like searching and sorting. Additionally you will transition from JavaScript ES5 to JavaScript ES6 along the way. I hope this book captures My enthusiasm for react and JavaScript and helps you to get started."
